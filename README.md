# SyatiSetup
Source code for the setup exe for Syati

This repo also has the source code for unrar, which is used by SyatiSetup.

## What it does
syatisetup.exe downloads unrar first, then downloads CodeWarrior and Kamek zips. unrar is then called to extract them properly. The .rar files and unrar.exe are then deleted.
